## A freshman comes

#### Today actualy is my first day to write a blog on the Internet, and there's a few things I want to mention, it's like I'm trying to do some preparations for my future blog.

### First: **some rules**
#### using only English to describe your work in details. Though sometimes we do make some grammatical errors, it's okay as long as you try.
#### writing regularly on github, post some of your demos, vary from different functions. (mostly connecting with font-end development).
#### **challenging yourself** by setting a goal from time to time. maybe a goal for a week or a month.

### Second: **predictions**
#### writing demo as much as you could and post them online (like everyday? It's hard at first but try to get used to this, it does a great benefits for your font-end development learning).
#### maybe I didn't mean to be a great programmer, but simply just try to make everything perfect.
#### this blog will record your learning procedure, you can earsily sort out what you've learnt in the future.

### Third: **don't settle**
#### the competitions in this industry is so much fierce than you can imaginate. So work hard on this, no excuses this time.

## challenges start now. I will try my best to post some code everyday...
